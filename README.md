# purescript-base

`purescript-base` intends to ease the development of Purescript applications by bundling mutually compatible versions of common functional libraries into a single package.

By making your libraries and applications depend on `purescript-base`, you can avoid some of the *dependency management hell* that one frequently encounters when working with quickly changing library ecosystems.

`purescript-base` is versioned semantically. Any point bump to any dependency is reflected in the version of `purescript-base`.
